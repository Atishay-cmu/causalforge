The datasets is first used for benchmarking treatment effect estimation algorithms in Hill [1], where selection bias is induced by removing non-random subsets of the treated individuals to create an observational dataset, and the outcomes are generated using the original covariates and treatments. It contains 747 subjects and 25 variables. In order to compare our results with the literature and make our results reproducible, we use the simulated outcome implemented as setting “A” in [2], and downloaded the data at https://www.fredjo.com/, which is composed of 1000 repetitions of the experiment.
